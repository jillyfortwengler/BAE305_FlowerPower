# Flower Power Plant Staycation

## Summary

The **Flower Power Plant Staycation** was thoughtfully designed with busy college students in mind â€” especially those who love their plants but may not always have the time to properly care for them. This innovative system features a fully automated watering and lighting setup that users can customize based on their plantâ€™s specific needs. A SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor continuously monitors soil moisture, triggering watering only when necessary to conserve water and prevent overwatering. An ultrasonic sensor monitors the water reservoir level and activates an LED indicator when a refill is needed. By automating essential plant care tasks, the Flower Power Plant Staycation helps students maintain healthy, thriving plants with minimal daily effort â€” even during exams or weekends away.

## Design Description

### Materials and Planning
We began by outlining the materials needed for the project. Key components were carefully selected based on their performance and compatibility:
- UV Grow Light to promote optimal plant growth
- Water pump motor capable of extended use
- Circuit parts, including an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module and a relay

### Part 1: Automated Watering System

**Motor and Soil Sensor Control:**
- The motor is connected to a relay, which switches it on and off based on soil moisture readings.
- A SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor detects when watering is needed.
- A piezo buzzer sounds during watering to alert the user.

**Reservoir Monitoring:**
- An ultrasonic sensor detects the water level in the reservoir.
- If the water level drops too low, an LED light illuminates to signal a refill is needed.
